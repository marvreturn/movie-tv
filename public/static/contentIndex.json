Because the show was canceled and later picked back up the last 2 seasons have a decidedly different feel and are slightly shorter.

The show centers around Shawn Spencer a super immature and aimless character with incredible abilities and eclectic knowledge base. Shawn gets forced into his natural calling as a crime solver using his amazing recall and keen observation skills to fake being a psychic. This is a modern day Sherlock Holmes.  If this is one of the first shows you are choosing to watch understand that you will miss out on many of the references being made. As you watch more and more things you will remember them being referenced in this show. Since the show is fairly episodic it is not necessary to start with the first episode and push through. I say this in particular as the pilot is one of the weaker episodes and is longer than a normal episode. I highly recommend Season 3 Episode 16 “An evening with Mr. Yang”, Season 4 Episode 1 “Extradition: British Columbia” or one of the numerous themed episodes such as Season 6 Episode 2 “Last night Gus” based on “The Hangover”, Season 3 Episode 15 “Tuesday the 17th” based on “Friday the 13th”, or Season 4 Episode 15 “The Head, the Tail, the Whole Damn Episode” based on “Jaws”.\nThe show ran for 8 seasons with 120 hour long (42min) episodes and 3 movies."},"TV-Shows-archive/Pushing-Daisies":{"title":"Pushing Daisies","links":["Bryan-Fuller","Lee-Pace","Anna-Friel","People-Archive/Chi-McBride"],"tags":[],"content":"Pushing Daisies\n\nComedy, Drama, Fantasy\nyear: 2007–2009\nseasons: 2\ncreator: Bryan Fuller\nactors: Lee Pace, Anna Friel, Chi McBride\navailability:\nA pastry chef with the power to bring dead people back to life solves murder mysteries with his resurrected childhood sweetheart, a cynical private investigator, and a lovesick waitress.\nwiki:"},"TV-Shows-archive/Rawhide":{"title":"Rawhide","links":["Charles-Marquis-Warren","People-Archive/Clint-Eastwood","Paul-Brinegar","Steve-Raines"],"tags":[],"content":"Rawhide\n\nWestern\nyear: 1959–1965\nseasons: 8\ncreator: Charles Marquis Warren\nactors: Clint Eastwood, Paul Brinegar, Steve Raines\navailability:\nGil Favor is trail boss of a continuous cattle drive.
