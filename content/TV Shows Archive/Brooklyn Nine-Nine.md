Brooklyn 99 is a sitcom that takes place in a detectives unit of the 99th precinct. This is a very funny show with well developed characters that is not focused on the crime solving as much as the interactions between the characters with the "police" aspect being more of a backdrop. The show primarily focuses on the growth and development of "Jake Peralta" a very immature but capable detective. Because the show was canceled and later picked back up the last 2 seasons have a decidedly different feel and are slightly shorter. Can easily watch from the very beginning as the pilot is fairly strong but top episodes include S5.E14 "The Box", any of the S1E16 "Halloween" Heist episodes, or any of the S1E12 "Pontiac Bandit" episodes. 

The show ran for 8 seasons with 153 half hour (23 min) episodes.
