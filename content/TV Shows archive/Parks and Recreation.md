Parks and Rec is a sitcom about small town government in Pawnee Indiana. The show revolves around Leslie Knope the assistant director of the parks and recreation department. The show starts fairly slow with a 6 episode first season but then picks up significantly in the second season. The slow start is mainly due to the initial setup of leslie as an incapable fool similar to the Michael Scott character from [[The Office]].  After the first season the made a huge correction making her hyper capable and the show starts to improve dramatically. The show really jumps from good to great with the additions of [[Adam Scott]] and [[Rob Lowe]] at the end of the second season. The show has a widely entertaining cast from "Ron Swanson" her libertarian boss to the intern "April Ludgate" who dislikes everything, or "Tom Haverford" how is always running a side hustle.

The show ran for 7 seasons with 126 half hour (23 min) episodes.
